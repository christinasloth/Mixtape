    <h2 id="first">Rue - girl in red</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      I remember you couldn't stop crying<br />
      You found me when I thought I was dying<br />
      Believe me when I say<br />
      I tried so hard to change<br />
      All the crazy shit I made you do<br />
      The long nights you held me through<br />
      Believe me when I say<br />
      I could never be saved<br />
      Be saved<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      Yeah, I tried<br />
      To get it off my mind<br />
      To leave it all behind<br />
      Don't wanna make it worse<br />
      I'm gonna make it work<br />
      Yeah, I tried<br />
      To get it off my mind<br />
      To leave it all bеhind<br />
      Don't wanna make it worse<br />
      I'm gonna make it work<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="second">Dark Red - Steve Lacy</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      Something bad is 'bout to happen to me<br />
      I don't know what, but I feel it coming<br />
      Might be so sad, might leave my nose running<br />
      I just hope she don't wanna leave me (Babe)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      [Chorus]<br />
      Don't you give me up, please don't give up<br />
      On me, I belong, with you, and only you, babe<br />
      Only you, my girl, only you, babe<br />
      Only you, darling, only you, babe<br />
      Only you, my girl, only you, babe<br />
      Only you, darling, only you<br />
    </p>


    <h2 id="third">creature - Half Alive</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      Look inside of me and see that I am not afraid<br />
      To walk inside the void like a kid inside a cave<br />
      Discovering the patterns of my soul and where it's placed<br />
      I've been mapping many caverns but it still feels like a maze<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pre-Chorus]<br />
      I know I'm made of clay that's worn<br />
      Blinded by imperfect form<br />
      But I will trust the artist molding me<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      I am creation, both haunted and holy<br />
      Made in glory<br />
      Even the depths of the night cannot blind me<br />
      When You guide me<br />
      Creature only<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="fourth">worldstar money - Joji</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse]<br />
      I looked at you and said, oh-oh-oh<br />
      Don't hate me, am I crazy?<br />
      So tenderly you watch me burn, you watch me burn, oh<br />
      So tell me, am I crazy?<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Bridge]<br />
      'Cause I do, 'cause I do<br />
      'Cause I do, 'cause I do<br />
      'Cause I do, 'cause I do<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Outro]<br />
      Ooh (La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la, goddamn)<br />
      Ooh (Oh)<br />
      And I don't wanna die<br />
      No, I don't wanna die<br />
      I don't wanna die<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="fifth">Run - Joji</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin<br />
      And though this is tragic, at least I found the end<br />
      I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins<br />
      And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      I know you're not in love like you used to be<br />
      Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think<br />
      So you'll just run<br />
      I know that I'm stuck in this misery<br />
      Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think<br />
      So I'll just run (Ooh)<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="sixth">1121 - Halsey</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      Well, I won't die for love<br />
      But I've got a body here to bury<br />
      And if truth be told, it's scary<br />
      'Cause my shoulders are heavy already<br />
      And, yeah, I know<br />
      The parts of myself that I've hated<br />
      And I can't tell which ones are mine<br />
      And which I created<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      But I won't die for love<br />
      But ever since I met you<br />
      You could have my heart<br />
      And I would break it for you<br />
      And I won't die for love<br />
      But ever since I met you<br />
      You could have my heart<br />
      And I would break it for you<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="seventh">Cassie - Chase Atlantic</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      The writing's on the wall right now<br />
      And I'm way too involved somehow<br />
      Shit, I probably tore her heart right out<br />
      At least that's how it feels right now (Yeah)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br />
      But we're holdin' on, we're holdin' on<br />
      We say some words, we land them wrong<br />
      Say what you need, then move along<br />
      She said, "It's seven in the morning, what'd you take me for?"<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      Cassie's been waiting too long<br />
      The drug in her veins is too strong<br />
      She fell in love with the medicine she's on<br />
      Yeah, in a matter of minutes, her mind's gone<br />
      Cassie's been waiting too long<br />
      Cassie's been waiting too long<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="eighth">Useless - I Know Leopard</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      If I was to listen to all of the things that you told me<br />
      Oh so lonely I would feel forever more<br />
      If I was to say all the wonderful phrases you throw me<br />
      Would you hold me, tell me I'm all you adore?<br />
      Running around, all the sights and the sounds overthrow me<br />
      Oh so lonely in a sea of open eyes<br />
      All of the words that pretend to be heard over-loathe me<br />
      They control me, too much matter over mind<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus]<br />
      Cause I'm utterly useless<br />
      Totally stupid now<br />
      Cause I'm utterly useless<br />
      Totally stupid now<br />
      Cause I'm utterly useless<br />
      Filthy and putrid now<br />
      Well I could try to use my head<br />
      But It's not, no it's not<br />
      In my heart<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="ninth">Who? - TSUKI, Shilo Dynasty</h2>
    <p>
      Come through<br />
      And let's do<br />
      What we do<br />
      In our imagination<br />
      When<br />
      Come through<br />
      And let's do<br />
      What we do<br />
      In our imagination<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="tenth">Losing My Love - Verzache</h2>
    <p>
        [Hook]<br />
      I'm losing my love for you<br />
      The feeling's just not there<br />
      You broke my heart into<br />
      Pieces on my bed<br />
      I'm losing my love for you<br />
      The feeling's just not there<br />
      You broke my heart into<br />
      Pieces on my bed<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse]<br />
      Stop playing games<br />
      I ain't here to play none<br />
      I just need someone to lean on<br />
      Story's getting old<br />
      I can't seem to like it<br />
      We should start all over and rewrite it<br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="eleventh">Only - RY X</h2>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br />
      Coming from the cold<br />
      Buried under heat<br />
      Lay you on the floor<br />
      Heavy like the force between us<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 2]<br />
      Cut me like a rose<br />
      Turn me like a beast<br />
      Hold me on the floor<br />
      Heavy like the force between us<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br />
      I was a ghost<br />
      Hunted and fled<br />
      Kneeling<br />
      There of the heart<br />
      God undertow<br />
      Feeling<br />
    </p>
